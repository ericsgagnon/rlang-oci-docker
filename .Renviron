# this file should be formatted the same as bash environment variables:
# variablename=variablevalue
# special characters should be escape with backticks or single quotes
# note that R (or rstudio?) doesn't seem to inherit environment variables
# from the system, so variable expansion may not work, if you need to
# inherit specific variables, you can run manually read them from .Rprofile
# example = '(3x@Mp!e$)'
